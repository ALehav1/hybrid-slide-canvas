# Hybrid Slide Canvas: AI-Powered Slide Creator

Hybrid Slide Canvas is a lightweight React 19 + Vite application that fuses **TLDraw 3** for drawing, **Rough.js** for a hand-drawn aesthetic, and an AI chat assistant for "text-to-diagram" creation.
Type **"add a blue rectangle"** and the shape appears—no manual toolbar clicks.

## 🚶 User Journey

1. **Create a New Presentation**: Start with an empty canvas or choose from slide templates
2. **Add Content Through Natural Language**: Use the AI chat to add shapes, text, and diagrams
3. **Refine with Direct Manipulation**: Adjust elements by dragging, resizing, or using property panels
4. **Organize Your Slides**: Create multiple slides, reorder them via the thumbnail bar
5. **Apply Consistent Styling**: Choose from themes or customize the look and feel
6. **Present or Export**: Share your finished presentation

## ⚡ Performance Metrics

| Metric | Performance |
|:---|:---|
| Slide switching | < 2ms |
| Shape creation | < 50ms |
| AI response time | 1-3s (dependent on OpenAI) |
| Canvas render | 60 FPS sustained |
| Initial load | < 1.5s to interactive |
| Memory usage | < 80MB baseline |

## 📋 Known Limitations

- Maximum 100 shapes per slide for optimal performance
- Canvas size limited to 4096x4096 pixels
- AI commands work best with simple, direct language
- Limited export formats (currently PNG only, PDF coming in Q3 2025)
- No offline mode for AI features (requires OpenAI API access)

## 📚️ Architecture

The application's state is managed by two primary systems:

1. **`Zustand` (`slidesStore.ts`)**: Handles global state related to the slide deck itself—the collection of slides, their order, and the currently active slide.
2. **[ConversationProvider.tsx](cci:7://file:///Users/arilehavi/hybrid-slide-canvas/src/components/ConversationProvider.tsx:0:0-0:0)**: A React context provider that serves as the single source of truth for all chat-related functionality. It manages UI state (input values, expanded panels), loading/error states, and the conversation history for every slide. This centralized approach prevents component-level state conflicts and ensures a predictable data flow.

All components that need access to chat functionality, like `ChatPanel`, consume the `useConversationContext` hook.

### Data Flow
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   ChatPanel │────▶│ConversationProvider│────▶│ OpenAI API  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                             │
                             ▼
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   aiActions.ts   │
                    └─────────────────┘
                             │
                             ▼
                    ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
                    │ tldrawHelpers.ts │────▶│ TLDraw Canvas│
                    └─────────────────┘     └─────────────┘
1. **User Interaction** → When a user types in the chat panel, the input is captured by `ChatPanel` and passed to [ConversationProvider](cci:1://file:///Users/arilehavi/hybrid-slide-canvas/src/components/ConversationProvider.tsx:22:0-364:2)
2. **AI Processing** → The conversation provider sends the message to the OpenAI API via `openaiClient`
3. **Response Parsing** → The AI response is parsed through [aiActions.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/arilehavi/hybrid-slide-canvas/src/components/Chat/aiActions.ts:0:0-0:0) to extract structured commands
4. **Canvas Updating** → Valid commands are executed via [tldrawHelpers.ts](cci:7://file:///Users/arilehavi/hybrid-slide-canvas/src/lib/tldrawHelpers.ts:0:0-0:0) to create/modify shapes on the current slide
5. **State Persistence** → Changes are saved to the Zustand store and persisted to `localStorage`

## 🎯 Development Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Predictable State**: All state changes flow through defined channels
- **Test-Driven**: Features are built with tests first
- **Performance First**: Every feature considers render impact
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core features work without AI, enhanced with it
- **Developer Experience**: Clear APIs, consistent patterns, helpful docs

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
Our testing strategy is multi-layered to ensure code quality and stability:

Testing Priorities
Core Functionality Tests
Component rendering and lifecycle
User interactions with critical UI elements
Data flow between components
Error handling for common failure modes
State management verification
Data Management Tests
API integration with OpenAI
Data transformation (AI responses → canvas shapes)
State updates in Zustand store
Local storage persistence and retrieval
Edge Cases
Error states and recovery
Loading states with proper UI feedback
Empty states (new slides, no history)
Boundary conditions in shape creation
Test Types
Unit Tests: Critical services and hooks (e.g., 
ConversationProvider
, openaiClient, slidesStore) are tested in isolation to verify their core logic.
Component Tests: React components are tested using @testing-library/react to simulate user interactions and assert that the UI behaves as expected.
Integration Tests: Key user flows, like submitting a chat message that results in a shape being drawn, are tested to ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.
Mock Organization
All mocks are kept in 
src/tests/test-utils/mocks/
Mocks are separated by type (UI components, API responses)
Exported through index.ts files for easy imports
Typed with TypeScript for type safety
All tests are run via Vitest. To execute the full suite:

bash
pnpm test
For development with visual test UI:

bash
pnpm test:ui

export function createCustomShape(editor: Editor, props: CustomShapeProps) {
  return editor.createShapes([
    {
      id: createShapeId(),
      type: 'custom',
      props: { ... },
      // Apply Rough.js styling
      style: { ...roughStyle },
    }
  ]);
}
```

3. Add to the shape factory in `tldrawHelpers.ts`
4. Create tests in `yourShape.test.ts`
